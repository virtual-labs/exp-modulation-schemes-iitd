      "question": "1. How does the Gaussian filter bandwidth-time product (BT) in GMSK affect the system’s trade-off between spectral efficiency and inter-symbol interference (ISI)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A higher BT value increases ISI but improves bandwidth efficiency",

      "question": "2. In GMSK, how does the presence of memory due to Gaussian filtering affect maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It simplifies MLSE by reducing symbol dependencies",

    {
      "question": "3. Why is MSK considered a special case of continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because it uses rectangular pulse shaping for frequency changes",
